Brain Tumor Classification using YOLOv11n

This project implements a deep learning pipeline using the YOLOv11n architecture for multi-class brain tumor detection from MRI images. The model is trained to classify four categories: No Tumor, Meningioma, Glioma, and Pituitary Tumor.

Model: YOLOv11n (lightweight and efficient for medical image tasks)

Training Set: 1370 images

Validation Set: 395 images

Test Set: 191 images

Total Dataset Size: 1956 MRI images

The model achieves fast and reliable inference suitable for real-time or resource-constrained medical environments.
